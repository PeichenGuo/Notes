# 最主要缺点
- 发音，口音不好。不能有明显口音，尾音部分重，这个改不了
- 语法错误太多了。三单，过去式
# 评分原则
![[Pasted image 20241008083534.png]]
三个维度：
- 表达：语速合适的流利度，发音，语调
- 语言使用
- 内容

==语速要降低==，才能提高流利度。
语调没法改，不改了

主要要提升的是流利度，发音和语法。

4个4分是30，4个3分是23。
23是一个坎，24分比23多一个4分。
24分不是一两个月能练出来的
现在用机器评分，只能听流利度 发音和语调。

# 独立口语
## 现状
内容可以了
发音是最大问题，读到后面发音出问题了。
但实际上内容不重要，说慢说好
发音要和第一句话匹配
前面的发音更重要。

## TPO练习
### 30
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a career.
Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.

#### agree:
I strongly agree that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children choose a career.
First of all, parents have more life experience and can ==offer valuable insights== into different ==professions==, helping their children make ==informed decisions==. For example, they can explain ==the pros and cons of== various career paths.
In addition, parents ==know their children well== and can guide them toward careers that ==match their strengths and interests==. Their support can also ==boost a child's confidence.==
Therefore, I agree that parents should assist in career choices.

#### disagree:
I strongly disagree that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children choose a career.

First of all, children ==know their own passions and interests better than anyone else==, and parental involvement might ==limit their ability to== explore freely. For example, a child interested in arts may ==be pushed toward== a more "secure" field like medicine.

In addition, parental pressure can ==lead to dissatisfaction in the long run== if the career chosen doesn't align with the child’s true aspirations.

Therefore, I disagree that parents should assist in career choices.

### 32
#### agree:
I strongly agree that children should receive money for doing household tasks such as cleaning.

First of all, it teaches them ==the value of hard work and responsibility==. By earning money through tasks, children learn that ==effort leads to rewards==, which can be ==a valuable life lesson==.

In addition, it helps children ==develop financial skills== early. For example, they can ==save or spend their earnings wisely==, understanding the importance of ==budgeting and saving for the future==.

Therefore, I agree that children should be paid for household tasks.
#### disagree
I strongly disagree that children should receive money for doing household tasks such as cleaning.

First of all, household chores are a responsibility that comes with being part of a family, and children should learn to contribute without expecting rewards. ==For instance==, cleaning up after themselves ==fosters a sense of== responsibility and teamwork within the family.

In addition, paying children for chores can ==undermine the intrinsic motivation to help==. If children are always paid, they may refuse to help unless rewarded, which can ==diminish the value of== cooperation.

Therefore, I disagree that children should be paid for household tasks.
### 33
#### agree
I strongly agree that eating healthy food is easier today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.

First of all, it is easier to get access to healthy food today. Many supermarkets and online stores ==offer a wide variety of== fresh produce and organic options, ==making it more convenient for people to== find nutritious food.

In addition, there are more choices available now. From plant-based alternatives to whole-grain products, people have many options to suit their dietary needs and preferences.

Therefore, I agree that eating healthy food is easier today due to better access and a wider range of choices.

#### disagree
I strongly disagree that eating healthy food is easier today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.
First of all, processed and fast foods ==are more readily available== and often cheaper than healthier options. For example, many people choose convenience over nutrition due to ==time constraints== and ==the affordability of== unhealthy foods.
In addition, modern marketing makes it harder to identify truly healthy foods. Many products are labeled as "healthy" or "natural," but they may still contain high amounts of sugar or additives, ==making informed choices difficult.==
Therefore, I disagree that eating healthy food is easier today than in the past.

### 34
#### agree
I strongly agree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
First of all, restricting private cars can significantly ==reduce traffic congestion==. For instance, fewer vehicles on the road can lead to ==smoother traffic flow==, making it easier for public transportation and emergency services to navigate the city.
In addition, banning private cars can ==improve air quality and reduce pollution==. Cities that limit car access often experience cleaner air, contributing to better public health and ==a more pleasant environment for== residents and visitors alike.
Therefore, I agree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
#### disagree
I strongly disagree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
First of all, many people ==rely on== their private cars for ==convenience and flexibility==. For instance, public transportation may not reach all areas, and banning cars could make commuting difficult for those who live far from their workplace.
In addition, banning private cars could ==hurt businesses== in city centers. Many shops and restaurants depend on customers who travel by car, and reduced access could ==impact their revenue==.
Therefore, I disagree that private cars should be banned from city centers in large cities.


I strongly disagree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
First of all, people often have emergency require private cars. ==In critical situations==, such as medical emergencies, ==having immediate access to== a personal vehicle can be ==life-saving== and essential for quick transportation.
In addition, aged and disabled individuals rely on cars for mobility. Public transportation may not always ==be accessible== or convenient for them, ==making private cars crucial for== their independence and ability to navigate the city comfortably.
Therefore, I disagree that private cars should be banned from city centers in large cities.

### 35
#### disagree
I strongly disagree that a university's academic reputation is the most important thing a student should consider when deciding which university to attend.

First of all, as someone who loves sports, I believe that the quality of the sports facilities is crucial. A university with ==top-notch== athletic facilities allows students to maintain a healthy lifestyle and ==enjoy extracurricular activities==.

In addition, industry resources ==are equally important==. A university that has strong connections with industries ==offers== more internship and job opportunities, which can be invaluable for career development.

Therefore, I disagree that academic reputation should be the top priority when choosing a university.

### 36
#### prefer latter
Personally, I prefer to buy fresh food and prepare meals myself.

First of all, cooking at home is healthier. I can control the ingredients, avoiding unhealthy additives like excess salt and oil often found in pre-prepared meals. This allows me to create more balanced, nutritious dishes.

In addition, cooking is fun. I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and ingredients, and the process of ==creating something from scratch gives me a sense of accomplishment.==

Therefore, I prefer cooking my own meals because it is both healthier and an enjoyable activity.

Personally, I prefer to play with many people.

First of all, it’s more relaxing. When I play with others, the shared experience makes the game more enjoyable, and I don’t feel pressured to entertain myself alone.

In addition, playing with many people helps me make more friends. Being in a group allows me to meet new people, build connections, and enjoy socializing while playing.
