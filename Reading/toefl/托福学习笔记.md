# 口语
## 最主要缺点
- 发音，口音不好。不能有明显口音，尾音部分重，这个改不了
- 语法错误太多了。三单，过去式
## 评分原则
![[Pasted image 20241008083534.png]]
三个维度：
- 表达：语速合适的流利度，发音，语调
- 语言使用
- 内容

==语速要降低==，才能提高流利度。
语调没法改，不改了

主要要提升的是流利度，发音和语法。

4个4分是30，4个3分是23。
23是一个坎，24分比23多一个4分。
24分不是一两个月能练出来的
现在用机器评分，只能听流利度 发音和语调。

## 独立口语
### 现状
内容可以了
发音是最大问题，读到后面发音出问题了。
但实际上内容不重要，说慢说好
发音要和第一句话匹配
前面的发音更重要。

- 不要理会beep sound，听完题就开想
- 笔记词不要很多，比如就7个词，要把时间花在组织语言上，而不是写笔记
- be flexible。不用非得说完两个点，看时间不够了就说第一个点的细节
- 找模板
- 不要想太。独立口语不在乎你想的对不对，只在乎你表达
- 用chatgpt来练，prompt如下![[Pasted image 20241004233534.png]]
- Build your own corpus
- 平时要积累素材；也要灵活，学会迁移，把背过的段子迁移使用；要刷对的题
- 背段子要扣题 。段子可以不背完，但要扣题
- 如果实在找不到说的，就只能举例子了。时间地点人物，起因经过结果。不要一上来就举例子，先扯一两句，实在说不出来了就立刻开始举例子。举的例子的那个人必须有个名字。

## 例题

Some people want to change their appearance, even by surgery. Do you agree or disagree? Give your reasons.
![[Pasted image 20241011084006.png]]


GPT prompt：
Based on the question above, write a 85-95 words short essay to say that you prefer/agree/disagree. Provide 2 reasons with specific details, using the following structure:




### TPO练习
#### 30
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a career.
Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.

##### agree:
I strongly agree that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children choose a career.
First of all, parents have more life experience and can ==offer valuable insights== into different ==professions==, helping their children make ==informed decisions==. For example, they can explain ==the pros and cons of== various career paths.
In addition, parents ==know their children well== and can guide them toward careers that ==match their strengths and interests==. Their support can also ==boost a child's confidence.==
Therefore, I agree that parents should assist in career choices.

##### disagree:
I strongly disagree that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children choose a career.

First of all, children ==know their own passions and interests better than anyone else==, and parental involvement might ==limit their ability to== explore freely. For example, a child interested in arts may ==be pushed toward== a more "secure" field like medicine.

In addition, parental pressure can ==lead to dissatisfaction in the long run== if the career chosen doesn't align with the child’s true aspirations.

Therefore, I disagree that parents should assist in career choices.

#### 32
##### agree:
I strongly agree that children should receive money for doing household tasks such as cleaning.

First of all, it teaches them ==the value of hard work and responsibility==. By earning money through tasks, children learn that ==effort leads to rewards==, which can be ==a valuable life lesson==.

In addition, it helps children ==develop financial skills== early. For example, they can ==save or spend their earnings wisely==, understanding the importance of ==budgeting and saving for the future==.

Therefore, I agree that children should be paid for household tasks.
##### disagree
I strongly disagree that children should receive money for doing household tasks such as cleaning.

First of all, household chores are a responsibility that comes with being part of a family, and children should learn to contribute without expecting rewards. ==For instance==, cleaning up after themselves ==fosters a sense of== responsibility and teamwork within the family.

In addition, paying children for chores can ==undermine the intrinsic motivation to help==. If children are always paid, they may refuse to help unless rewarded, which can ==diminish the value of== cooperation.

Therefore, I disagree that children should be paid for household tasks.
#### 33
##### agree
I strongly agree that eating healthy food is easier today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.

First of all, it is easier to get access to healthy food today. Many supermarkets and online stores ==offer a wide variety of== fresh produce and organic options, ==making it more convenient for people to== find nutritious food.

In addition, there are more choices available now. From plant-based alternatives to whole-grain products, people have many options to suit their dietary needs and preferences.

Therefore, I agree that eating healthy food is easier today due to better access and a wider range of choices.

##### disagree
I strongly disagree that eating healthy food is easier today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.
First of all, processed and fast foods ==are more readily available== and often cheaper than healthier options. For example, many people choose convenience over nutrition due to ==time constraints== and ==the affordability of== unhealthy foods.
In addition, modern marketing makes it harder to identify truly healthy foods. Many products are labeled as "healthy" or "natural," but they may still contain high amounts of sugar or additives, ==making informed choices difficult.==
Therefore, I disagree that eating healthy food is easier today than in the past.

#### 34
##### agree
I strongly agree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
First of all, restricting private cars can significantly ==reduce traffic congestion==. For instance, fewer vehicles on the road can lead to ==smoother traffic flow==, making it easier for public transportation and emergency services to navigate the city.
In addition, banning private cars can ==improve air quality and reduce pollution==. Cities that limit car access often experience cleaner air, contributing to better public health and ==a more pleasant environment for== residents and visitors alike.
Therefore, I agree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
##### disagree
I strongly disagree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
First of all, many people ==rely on== their private cars for ==convenience and flexibility==. For instance, public transportation may not reach all areas, and banning cars could make commuting difficult for those who live far from their workplace.
In addition, banning private cars could ==hurt businesses== in city centers. Many shops and restaurants depend on customers who travel by car, and reduced access could ==impact their revenue==.
Therefore, I disagree that private cars should be banned from city centers in large cities.


I strongly disagree that private cars should not be allowed in the city centers of large cities.
First of all, people often have emergency require private cars. ==In critical situations==, such as medical emergencies, ==having immediate access to== a personal vehicle can be ==life-saving== and essential for quick transportation.
In addition, aged and disabled individuals rely on cars for mobility. Public transportation may not always ==be accessible== or convenient for them, ==making private cars crucial for== their independence and ability to navigate the city comfortably.
Therefore, I disagree that private cars should be banned from city centers in large cities.

#### 35
##### disagree
I strongly disagree that a university's academic reputation is the most important thing a student should consider when deciding which university to attend.

First of all, as someone who loves sports, I believe that the quality of the sports facilities is crucial. A university with ==top-notch== athletic facilities allows students to maintain a healthy lifestyle and ==enjoy extracurricular activities==.

In addition, industry resources ==are equally important==. A university that has strong connections with industries ==offers== more internship and job opportunities, which can be invaluable for career development.

Therefore, I disagree that academic reputation should be the top priority when choosing a university.

#### 36
##### prefer latter
Personally, I prefer to buy fresh food and prepare meals myself.

First of all, cooking at home is healthier. I can control the ingredients, avoiding unhealthy additives like excess salt and oil often found in pre-prepared meals. This allows me to create more balanced, nutritious dishes.

In addition, cooking is fun. I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and ingredients, and the process of ==creating something from scratch gives me a sense of accomplishment.==

Therefore, I prefer cooking my own meals because it is both healthier and an enjoyable activity.

- 不要记下所有东西，都读完了，抓住gist后，用exist order in speaking来记下几个词，别给自己挖坑
- note taking template。
- 准备时间要干的事情：![[Pasted image 20241004233940.png]]
- stick to your note，千万别漏点，用手划着说
- 时刻注意时间。阅读材料的一个点，听力的两个点，时间大概均分
- 准备套话来填补后面的空余时间
- 说不完不要提速，要讲重要的东西
- 记笔记顺序非常重要！ 动词>名词
- 学会偷懒，不要写全部句子，部分常用名词要简写
- 复查笔记的时候要做到，补添删圈。没写的补上，不全的添加细节，看不懂的直接删掉，重要的圈起来。
- 准备时间不要补笔记
![[Pasted image 20241011100142.png]]

### 题型
#### task2 公告题
一个学校公告+两个学生讨论
文章很短，45秒读，足够读完不要慌。尽量30秒读完+记笔记


笔记技巧：
- 标题要注意
- 一句话说学校要干啥。记录key word，语序要对
- 对折，记录的时候左右写M和F
- 一般赞同/反对的那个人会说 喜欢哪个点，为什么；或者是不喜欢那个点，为什么，还可能给个solution。
- 时间富裕了，那就加一句 that's why the woman/man agrees/doesn't agree with this. 
- 阅读记得的时候不要记难词，找简单的表达方式
- 可以不用as adj as xx，直接用adj就行了。

#### task3 学术名词题
45秒看一个短文，一般是介绍一个学术名词；然后听一个lecture，一般是这个名词的例子
30秒准备 1分钟回答
例子很重要

主要考两种，各占一半
- 商学，教育学，心理学
- 生物学

非生物学特点：
- 剧情比较绕。如果照着说根本说不完。彩排的时候，说的时候要想定义句，多说这些细节，没用的直接去掉。
- 时态高频考察。经常想不起来过去式。时态不是反映出来的，是平时练出来的。练习的时候一定要非常注意时态。
- 实验题最重要的是，对照和结论。
##### 技巧：
- 听力的重点细节：和定义句有关的内容
- task3是最难的
- 说不完无所谓，但不能卡也不能有语法错误。
- 非常需要彩排
- 一定要听清那个学术名词怎么读，一定不要读错
- 生物学听力比较难，草稿纸要记出现动词和形容词
- 并列细节要删减，比如两个要选一个，三个四个要选两个
- 一句话已经说不明白了就不要纠结，赶紧不要说然后说下一句话
- 实在找不到定义句可以不说，可能不扣分，比费劲说好。
- 不要重复一些观点，因为浪费时间。
- ![[Pasted image 20241014111041.png]]
- 假如说例子里说的那个名词听不明白，听不懂，或者不知道怎么发音，可以用某某动物种群 a species of n.单数 来替代。
- 生物题里predator非常容易出现，用Pred简写；predator的剧情很多，可以固定住一些表达，比如predator is near, predator approaches, 

 #### 练习技巧
- 如果一个地方非常卡，一个句子怎么说都卡，就直接背原文的原句


##### 模板
According to the reading, xxx means.
The professor uses ... as an example to explain it.
That‘s how the prof explains the concept of + 题目

 其中uses后面的事例子的主人公，千万不要复杂，不要超过三四个单词。
其中如果是实验题，example直接是experiment。

#### task4 学术概括题
模板：
![[Pasted image 20241006205955.png]]

技巧：
- 只听听力的，不要加入个人常识！
- 第一句话百分之五十的几率甚至可以直接念，比如题干就是using points and examples from the lecture, explain 2 problems of .....。此时直接读后面就好。
- 分论点最好一句话，没必要过多解释，根本没时间解释。除非有些题解释很长，例子非常非常短，没啥说的。
- 建议都记，听到具体的例子的时候再把没用的删掉
- 准备时间20s，没时间彩排，记的时候一定要能复述。可以少记点，防止复述不了。
- 如果剩时间了，就把题干再读一遍。
- 非生物学仍是时态问题，过去式
- 有些题还会问一下前面的话的内容，但一般也就一句话


如何更准确地叙述分论点
![[Pasted image 20241101103538.png]]
主语就是问题里的那个

如果没法念题干：


Personally, I prefer to play with many people.

First of all, it’s more relaxing. When I play with others, the shared experience makes the game more enjoyable, and I don’t feel pressured to entertain myself alone.

In addition, playing with many people helps me make more friends. Being in a group allows me to meet new people, build connections, and enjoy socializing while playing.

### Rules of thumb
![[Pasted image 20241022202408.png]]
字多不会被扣分，但也没必要很多
主要是要反应你读懂了听懂了，复述较多细节

阅读3分钟

技巧：
- 尽量不要写有主观意志的词语，比如 in my opinion
- 采分点在听力而非写作
- 如果听力是部分否定（承认一部分但否定一部分）
- 要写到400字

### 模板：

The reading established ...., all of which are refuted by the lecture.

## 学术写作
### 答题流程
![[Pasted image 20241024000548.png]]
#### 审题
![[Pasted image 20241024000152.png]]
答题区域五个部分。
1：套话，可以快速扫一眼
2： 讨论背景导入，快速扫一眼
3：==核心题目== 真正的注意事项在这里
4和5：两个同学对3的问题进行讨论。提出观点+支持的理由

要写什么呢？
抓住核心题眼，了解前两位的观点和理由后提出自己的观点，对学术讨论有贡献
注意，不能使用别人的观点

#### 提纲
两种，自给型或者让步型。没有好坏区别，自己熟练哪个用哪个。后者套话多，字数多
![[Pasted image 20241024000644.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241024000749.png]]
#### 万能论证
![[Pasted image 20241024000908.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241024000947.png]]
例证就是写一个事件来支撑你的论证
托福不考察任何逻辑能力，只要写出来就行
==不要纠结逻辑！！==
### 答题方式
#### 逻辑链方法
一整条逻辑都是一串的，也就是把简单的逻辑给拉长。
比如下题：
Do you think it's a good idea for very young children to play educational computer games? Why or why not?
想说玩游戏-伤眼睛，可以拓展成“玩游戏不好 —— 看屏幕时间长 —— 伤眼睛 —— 视力下降 —— 戴眼镜 —— 不方便”，就是小学生作文
字数不够再写个例子

主题句：我觉得小孩玩教育游戏不好，因为这会让他们的生活很不方便。
解释：当小孩在玩游戏的时候，他们需要长时间看屏幕。看屏幕时间长，就会伤害到眼睛。如果视力下降了，就需要戴眼镜，这会让他们的生活很不方便。
例子：当我五岁的时候，我妈给我买了一台电脑，里面有一个游戏，教我学英语。游戏很有趣，我每天玩2个小时。三个月后，我发现自己在幼儿园看不清黑板，所以不得不戴上眼镜。每次有朋友找我出去玩，我都需要找眼镜，有时甚至需要找一个小时。

#### 让步段方法
可以水字数。

比如：
让步:虽然电脑是重要工具，但后期有机会学习。
While Kelly mentions that computers are crucial tools these days, children still have chances to learn how to operate these devices later at school.


### 技巧
- 尽量写到150词，7个错误以内，才能写到5分；170字，7个句子，5个错误以内，比较稳定。句子数不能太多
![[Pasted image 20241024085206.png]]![[Pasted image 20241024085435.png]]![[Pasted image 20241024085510.png]]

- 文章要切题！看好限定词，一定要非常注意
- 展开要充分，逻辑和例子
- 例子可以写典型的一天。
- 练习时注重字数和正确率
- ==词汇和语法错误要少==，宁可不要高难度词汇和句子。不要特别地背高级词汇硬套，不如用高级句式。正确率永远优先于高级表达。考官会看短板，低级错误会大大影响考官影响。
- gpt prompt：rewrite this article to make it more academic and sound like native writers:
- 如果实在实在想不到理由，可以和人物观点一样，但话要不一样
- 如果写完还有时间，可以反驳一下另一个人，不需要特别有理；或者写第二个道理。
- 大概率是没有统一检查的时间的。
- 举的例子要扣题，还要扣自己的逻辑！比如题目说gap year，在instance里我就说我自己gap了，然后再贴合自己的例子。
- 例子可以写小例子。
- 一般顺着说好说

常用理由
- 政府要不要花钱做什么事，这种题，如果顺着不好说，可以直接说不支持，因为xxx更重要
- 收税类：环保；收钱后可以放在更重要的领域

### 练习
### the government attracts more people
P: Let's think about population trends in urban and rural areas (villages). Living in urban areas can be expensive; nonetheless, when they have a choice of where to live, people in some countries do not wish to live in rural areas even if the cost of living there is lower. If governments of some countries want to attract more people to live in rural areas or villages, what is the best strategy or approach that governments can use? Why?

  

S1: I would live in a rural area if the government gave more financial help to farmers. Although it may cost very little to live in a rural area, it costs a lot to begin a career in agriculture. If Ihad financial help, I would start my own farm and be happy to live in a rural area.

  

S2: In my country, urban centers are great places to live because you can access shops, restaurants, and museums. If the government of my country wanted to attract me to live in a rural area, the area would first have to attract more businesses focused on entertainment and culture than most rural areas have now.

154 words 7 errors
I agree with the opinion of S2 about more entertainment facilities. In addition, I think the government should also take education into consideration. Many families, especially in Asia, consider educating their kids as the prime goal of their life. The educational infrastructures in the rural areas, however, are far worse than urban areas. For instance, I lived in countryside when I was a kid, I studied in a primary school which had 2 teachers in it. One of them taught me English and Chinese, the other taught me other subjects like math. They were exhausted giving too many courses. Then my mother was concerned about my education so that she took me to the urban area. I studied in a very large school with countless teachers. Every teacher only had to take care of a few students. Therefore, the government definitely should strengthen the education in rural area in order to attract more people.
